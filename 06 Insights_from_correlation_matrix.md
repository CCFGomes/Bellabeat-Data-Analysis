Insights from the Correlation Matrix:

The correlation matrix shows the relationships between various features in the dataset. The values range from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.

TotalSteps, TotalDistance, TotalActiveMinutes, TotalActiveHours, LightlyActiveMinutes, and VeryActiveMinutes:
TotalSteps and TotalDistance have a very high positive correlation of approximately 0.99, indicating that they are almost perfectly linearly related. This is expected since more steps typically result in covering more distance.
TotalSteps and TotalActiveMinutes, as well as TotalDistance and TotalActiveMinutes, have positive correlations around 0.77 and 0.62, respectively. It suggests that higher step counts and greater distances covered are associated with more active minutes.
FairlyActiveMinutes and ModeratelyActiveDistance:

FairlyActiveMinutes and ModeratelyActiveDistance have a high positive correlation of about 0.96, indicating that participants who spend more time in fairly active activities tend to cover a greater distance during moderately active activities.
VeryActiveMinutes and VeryActiveDistance:

VeryActiveMinutes and VeryActiveDistance have a strong positive correlation of approximately 0.84, suggesting that participants who spend more time in very active activities tend to cover longer distances during such activities.
Calories and TotalActiveMinutes:

Calories burned and TotalActiveMinutes have a moderate positive correlation of around 0.55. This indicates that more active minutes are generally associated with higher calorie burn.
BMI and WeightKg:

BMI and WeightKg (weight in kilograms) have a moderate positive correlation of approximately 0.62, indicating that higher body weights are associated with higher BMI values.
MinuteAverage and HourlyAverage:

The correlations between "MinuteAverage" and "HourlyAverage" with other variables are relatively weak. While there are some correlations, they are not strong enough to draw definitive conclusions about their direct impact on activity levels
